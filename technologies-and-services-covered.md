[Building Serverless Solutions with Azure and .NET](https://github.com/TaleLearnCode/BuildingServerlessSolutions) \ [Beer City Code 2024](README.md)  \

# Technologies and Services Covered

During this workshop, you will gain exposure to the following technologies and Azure services:

## Azure Functions

Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that allows you to run trigger-driven code without explicitly provisioning or managing infrastructure. Here are some key points:

- **Triggered-Driven**: Azure Functions are triggered by various events, such as HTTP requests, timers, database changes, and messages from queues or topics.
- **Scalability**: Functions automatically scale based on demand, ensuring that your application can handle varying loads efficiently.
- **Cost-Effective**: You only pay for the execution time of your functions (unless you are using Always Ready instances), making it a cost-effective solution for many use cases.
- **Multiple Languages**: You can write functions in various languages, including C#, JavaScript, Python, Java, and PowerShell.
- **Integration**: Azure Functions integrates seamlessly with other Azure services, such as Azure Storage, Event Hubs, and Service Bus.

## Azure Cosmos DB

**Azure Cosmos DB** is a globally distributed, multi-model database service. It offers turnkey global distribution across any number of Azure regions by transparently scaling and replicating your data wherever your users are. Key features include:

- **Globally Distributed**: Provides low-latency access to data by distributing it across multiple regions.
- **Multi-Model Database**: Supports various data models such as key-value, documents, graphs, and column-family data.
- **Storage for Various Data**: Efficiently stores configuration data, recipes, and user profiles, making it versatile for different applications.

## Azure API Management

Azure API Management is a fully managed service that helps organizations publish APIs to external, partner, and internal developers. Here are some key aspects:

### Key Components

- **API Gateway**: This acts as a facade to the backend services, handling all client application requests and forwarding them to the appropriate backend services. It enables consistent routing, security, throttling, caching, and observability configuration.
- **Management Plane**: Provides tools for managing APIs, including creating, publishing, securing, and analyzing APIs.
- **Developer Portal**: A customizable portal where developers can discover, learn about, and consumer APIs. It includes API documentation, interactive API consoles, and subscription management.

### Features

- **API Mocking**: Allows you to create mock responses for APIs that are still under development, enabling front-end and back-end teams to work in parallel.
- **Security**: Provides various security features such as authentication, authorization, IP filtering, and rate limiting to protect your APIs.
- **Analytics**: Offers insights into API usage, performance, and health, helping you make data-driven decisions.
- **Versioning and Revisions**: Supports API versioning and revisions, allowing you to manage changes and updates to your APIs without disrupting consumers.
- **Integration**: Easily integrates with other Azure services and third-party tools, enhancing the overall API ecosystem.

### Use Cases

- **Legacy Modernization**: Abstracts and modernizes legacy backends, making them accessible from new cloud services and modern applications.
- **Multi-Channel User Experiences**: Enables APIs to support web, mobile, wearable, or IoT applications, accelerating development and ROI.
- **B2B Integration**: Lowers the barrier to integrating business processes and exchanging data between business entities through APIs.

Azure API Management is a powerful tool for managing the entire lifecycle of your APIs, from creation and deployment to monitoring and security.

## Application Insights

**Application Insights** is an application performance management service that provides monitoring and diagnostics for your applications. It helps you understand how your applications are performing and how they can be improved. Key features include:

- **Monitoring and Performance Insights**: Track the performance and usage of your applications in real time.
- **Optimization**: Gain actionable insights to optimize your solution based on collected data.

------

Each of these services plays a crucial role in building robust, scalable, and efficient serverless solutions on the Azure platform. Understanding their capabilities and how they integrate will empower you to create sophisticated applications that meet modern demands.
